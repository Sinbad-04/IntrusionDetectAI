## ✨ Features

- 🎥 Detect and count objects directly from video (`.mp4`, `.avi`, etc.)
- 🔄 Export processed video with bounding boxes and counts
- 🧠 Pre-trained model available (`model.pt`)
- ⚡ Supports both real-time processing and offline video files
- 🧪 Separate test/demo script for quick validation

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python **3.8+**
- Required libraries:
  - `torch`
  - `opencv-python`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib` *(optional, for visualization)*
  - `tqdm` *(for progress bar)*
